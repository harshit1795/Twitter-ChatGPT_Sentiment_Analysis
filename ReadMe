Kindly refer to the following three files:

1. Twitter ETL.ipynb. - Python Code to retireve Tweets data using Tweepy package.

2. ChatGPTModule.ipynb - Python Code to interact with ChatGPT utilizing Prompt Engineering.

3. Twitter_ETL_py.py  - DAG file for Airflow. This should be saved in your Airflow folder inside dag in order for Airflow to detect the DAG.

Also, I've used my own API keys for ChatGPT & Twitter which are disabled now.
